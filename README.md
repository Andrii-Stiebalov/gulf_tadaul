# gulf_tadaul

Implementation of site layout. 
I used: HTML ğŸ“°, CSS ğŸ–Œ, JS âœ¨ and SwiperğŸ‘† in my work.

The scale was incorrect in the layout, so many dimensions are taken from my head.
and also cut out the woman from the background on the layout, so the edges of the picture may not be smoothğŸ˜…
